# djHeroClone
A little demo for my future(implying that`ll i ever find time enough to finish it) DJ Hero Clone

It has 

* no track constructor
* a lot of extra useless files
* no optimisation
* my questionable music taste
* some gameplay
* bad controls
* no settings

Its mostly fun project that i did in a week(and yet i`m proud to say i made it) just to test if I like unity(which i like very much). Usually im fullstack c#/angular developer, if by any means u find it and decide to use it as template for future projects(god bless your poor soul) I would be really happy.I would like to hear any feedback(positive and negative) because some time in a future i will finish this game.
